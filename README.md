# Data Augmentation using GANs Architecture Specifically Image Data Augmentation for a Quality Inspection Task

Our main goal is to augment images for a Quality Inspection Task which suffers from an imbalanced dataset, our objective is to train a GAN architecture to learn from these limited images dataset (By Classes) and tries to generate similar images to each class.

We've gone through benchmarking two popular GAN Architecture:
1- DC-GAN: Which is an architecture that relies heavily on the CNN.
2- CycleGAN: Which is a style tranfer architecture from domain A to domain B.

# Get Started

Each folder is subsequently containing the related work in a notebook format.

By the way each notebook relies on a dataset whcih was brought to the notebook via the Kaggle Input Dataset.
